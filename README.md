# Android Developer Candidate Code Challenge

Congratulations on making it to the next phase of the interview process. We’ve developed this code challenge to help us evaluate where you are on your Android developer journey.

We’d like you to spend no more than 3 hours on this. We understand this is a serious time commitment, and we appreciate your willingness to help ensure you’ll be a great fit with our Android development team.

We’d like for you to create a simple application from scratch. At a follow-up interview, we’ll ask you to show your app to a small group of Android developers (a code review). You’ll demonstrate the working app and then walk them through the code. They’ll ask questions about your approach to solving the coding challenges faced while developing this application.

Good luck!

## The Rules

- We expect you to write all of the code (excluding open-source libraries or auto-generated code) for this challenge. We’ll know you wrote the code if you can clearly explain it during the code review.
- We’ll need you to write this app in **Kotlin**. Java experience is highly valued, but Kotlin language experience is required. React Native and other hybrid solutions are not acceptable.
- Use **Jetpack Compose** for the user interface.
- Use any architectures, patterns, or techniques that you feel are appropriate for this task. Play to your skillset.
- You may use the internet for help just as you normally would to find answers and code examples.
- You can use any open-source libraries in your project.
- You can ask for help or clarification at any time. Contact the person who sent you this code challenge and we’ll do our best to respond quickly. But if you don’t hear from us, keep coding so we have an example of your work to discuss during the review.
- There is a 3-hour time limit.

## The Task

Create an Android application that allows a user to search Flickr for images. Create the UI with a search bar at the top and a grid below it to display thumbnail images. The user should be able to enter text into the search bar and see a grid of images whose tags match the search string. The search string can be a single word (such as “porcupine”) or comma-separated words (such as “forest, bird”).

Fetch the list of images using this API from Flickr:
`https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json&nojsoncallback=1&tags=porcupine`

You’ll replace “porcupine” in that URL with the search word(s) typed by the user. This is a free public feed. No API key is required. You can learn more about this API here: The App Garden

When you’ve finished, create a public repository for your project and email the link to us. GitHub will let you create public repositories for free, but any repository we can access is fine.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The search results should come from the API listed above (replacing the word “porcupine” with the one typed by the user).
- The search results should be updated after each keystroke or change to the search string.
- When performing the search, show a progress indicator without blocking the UI.
- Tapping on an image should display an image detail view that contains the following details:
  - The image
  - Text element that displays the title
  - Text element that displays the description
  - Text element that displays the author
  - Text element that displays a formatted version of the published date

- Add at least one unit test that covers some portion of your code.

### Extra Credit

Once again, there’s little value in spending more than three hours on this project. It’s more important that you demonstrate the basics well. If you complete the initial acceptance criteria with time left over, consider some of these optional tasks:

- Accessibility support such as:
  - Large font support
  - Talkback support
- Additional unit tests
- UI tests
- Support landscape orientation
- Add a button in the detail view to share the image and metadata
- Animate the image transition from the grid view to the detail view
- Add a text element that displays the width and height of the image to the detail page
  - Note: This can be parsed from the description field

## What We’re Looking For

During the code review, we’ll be looking for certain things that might indicate you have the skills we’re looking for. These things include:

- Excellent communication skills.
- Good coding practices. Industry-standard patterns and techniques.
- Well-formatted source code, a clean and consistent style, and proper
